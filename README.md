This project is a Deep learning CNN project which is to detect all kinds of pepsi bottles and mountain dew bottles
1)This is a complex CNN model trained on 10000 images of pepsi and mountaindew bottles respectively
2)This model overall accuracy is 87 %
3)To run the model install the dependencies by using requirements.txt file using command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4)Place some images of pepsi and mounatin dew in the test folder
5)Run the test.py file

caution:
The prediction made by the model is totally based on the trained dataset ,any result from the model doesn't mean to harm anyone in anyways, its always predicted one
and the images in the test folder(3 images given already) belongs to the properiatary companies, i doesn't own
any ownership or legal claims to the images, "use with caution"
